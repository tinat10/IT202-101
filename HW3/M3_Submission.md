    2. **Important**: The function that drives one of the challenges is `updateCurrentPage(str)` which takes 1 parameter, a string of the word to display as the current page. This function is not included in the code of the page, along with a few other things, are linked via an external js file. Make sure you do not delete this line.  
5. Create a branch called M3-Challenge-HW if you haven't yet
6. Add this template to that branch (git add/git commit)
7. Make a pull request for this branch once you push it
8. You may manually deploy the HW branch to dev to get the evidence for the below prompts
9. Create a new file **m3_submission.md** file in the hw branch and fill it with the output generated from this page (be careful not to paste more than once)
10. Add, commit, and push the submission file
11. Close the pull request by merging it to dev (double-check all looks good on dev)
12. Manually create a new pull request from dev to prod (i.e., base: prod <- compare: dev)
13. Complete the merge to deploy to production
14. Submit the direct link of the m3_submission.md from the prod branch to Canvas for this submission

<table><tr><td> <em>Deliverable 2: </em> Explain Solutions (Grader use this section to determine completion of each challenge) </td></tr><tr><td><em>Status: </em> <img width="100" height="20" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54863474/211707773-e6aef7cb-d5b2-4053-bbb1-b09fc609041e.png"></td></tr>
<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Briefly explain how you made the navigation horizontal</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I made the display of the navigation list (nav li) equal to &quot;inline&quot;<br>which makes the entire bar horizontal. This works because inline means horizontal and<br>setting this to the display shifts the vertical display to be horizontal.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Briefly explain how you remove the navigation list item markers</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>By making the navigation list in line with each other, the item markers<br>disappeared. I just set the display to &quot;inline&quot; and the item markers were<br>no longer there. This works because the &quot;inline&quot;&nbsp; removes the line breaks before<br>and after each list item, to display them on one line without the<br>item markers.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> Briefly explain how you gave the navigation a background</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I gave the navigation bar a background by setting the background-color property in<br>the nav li brackets to a color I wanted its background to be.<br>I used aquamarine. This works because the background-color property sets the navigation bar<br>to have a highlighted background text color.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 4: </em> Briefly explain how you made the links (or their surrounding area) change color on mouseover/hover</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I used the nav li: hover selector to change the links when a<br>person&#39;s mouse hovers over them. In this section, I set a different color,<br>blueviolet, to the background-color property. Therefore, the color will change when a user<br>hovers over the text. This works because the :hover feature detects the mouse<br>and will set the property to blueviolet. It will switch back to aquamarine<br>when the mouse no longer hovers over it.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 5: </em> Briefly explain how you changed the challenge list bullet points to checkmarks (âœ“)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I used the list-style-type property and set it equal to a checkmark I<br>found online. I placed this in the ul li brackets to ensure only<br>the bullet points after the text &quot;challenges&quot; would change. This works because the<br>list-style-property switches from the default bullet point to the character I set it<br>equal to.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 6: </em> Briefly explain how you made the first character of the h1 tags and anchor tags uppercased</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>In the h1 and a tag in CSS, I set the text-transform property<br>to &quot;capitalize&quot;, so that only the first character of each of the tags<br>would be uppercased. This works because the &quot;capitalize&quot; method only changes the first<br>letter like I want it to. Setting it equal to the text-transform property<br>in the h1 and a tags correctly change the words that I want<br>it to.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 7: </em> Briefly explain/describe your custom styling of your choice</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I changed the overall background of my website to cornflower blue because the<br>original color looked boring. I also changed the text color to white, so<br>that it is easier on the eyes. The black was too harsh. I<br>also italicized the words and changed the want to &#39;Lucida Sans&#39;, so it<br>looks nicer.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 8: </em> Briefly explain how the styling for the challenge list doesn't impact the navigation list</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The styling for the challenge list doesn&#39;t impact the navigation list because I<br>reference different parts of the HTML to change each part. When changing the<br>navigation bar, I make the changes to nav li which changes the navigation<br>list specifically. For the challenge list, I reference the ul li to make<br>changes.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 9: </em> Briefly explain how you updated the content of the h1 tag with the link text</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I changed the eventlistener to &quot;click&quot; so that whenever I clicked on the<br>link, the h1 tag would change immediately. I used the document.querySelector method to<br>access the h1 tag and set its innerhtml property to the window.location.href (the<br>link). This works because the querySelector method allows me to modify the h1<br>tag and set its text equal to whatever link I clicked on.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 10: </em> Briefly explain how you updated the content of the title tag with the link text</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I changed the eventlistener to &quot;click&quot; so that whenever I clicked on the<br>link, the title would change. I used the document.querySelector method to access the<br>title tag and set its innerhtml property to window.location.href (the link). This works<br>because the querySelector method allows me to modify the&nbsp;title and set its text<br>equal to whatever link I clicked on.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Comment briefly talking about what you learned and/or any difficulties you encountered and how you resolved them (or attempted to)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I had trouble with the two javascript parts of the homework. I was<br>able to resolve them by doing some research on what getCurrentSelection is and<br>what type of return type it wants. I also had to&nbsp;look up how<br>to access the h1 and title tag. Eventually, I came across the querySelector()<br>which luckily worked for me. Besides those difficulties, everything else was fine.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
